## What "Early Access" Means

You're using a working product that is still being refined based on real usage. This means:

- Features may change
- APIs may change (we'll notify you)
- There may be bugs
- Downtime may occur

---

## What We Commit To

✅ We will notify you before breaking API changes  
✅ We will make reasonable efforts to keep the service running  
✅ We will respond to support requests (best effort)  
✅ We will not share your data with third parties  
✅ We will back up your data regularly  

---

## What We Do NOT Guarantee

❌ 99.9% uptime or any specific SLA  
❌ Compliance with SOC2, HIPAA, or other certifications  
❌ Completeness of logged events (integrity only)  
❌ 24/7 support or guaranteed response times  
❌ Permanent API stability (though we'll try to minimize changes)  

---

## Data & Privacy

- We store hashes and metadata, not raw content (by default)
- Your data is isolated (single-tenant instance)
- We do not sell or share your data
- You can request data export or deletion at any time

---

## Your Responsibilities

- Keep your API key secure
- Handle logging failures gracefully in your application
- Report bugs or issues so we can fix them
- Understand that this is integrity verification, not completeness verification

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

Contact us at [your-email]. We'll work with you to resolve issues.

If the service is down:
- Your application should continue functioning (logging is non-blocking)
- Events during downtime won't be recorded
- We'll notify you when service is restored

---

## Feedback Welcome

Early access exists so we can learn. Tell us:
- What's working
- What's confusing
- What's missing
